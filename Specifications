Program is task driven, NOT efficiency driven. 

Mini-STL library program contains the following containers:
-	miniStackVT (a miniStack implemented using <vector>)
-	miniStackLT (a miniStack implemented using <list>)
-	miniStackDA (a miniStack implemented using dynamic array)
-	miniQueueVT (a miniQueue implemented using <vector>)
-	miniQueueLT (a miniQueue implemented using <list>)
-	miniQueueDA (a miniQueue implemented using dynamic array)

Implements a driver program with menu options to allow users to test all containers by:
-	adding/remove elements to a container, 
-	displaying the content/size of a container,
-	displaying the value of the front/top element in a container,

Includes exception handling in library.
